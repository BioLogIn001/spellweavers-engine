    1: """Prevents all non-"Dispel Magic" spells from being cast this turn. Removes all active (temporary and permanent) effects from all participants and monsters (but does not remove spells already stored by Delay Effect). Kills all monsters at the end of turn, allowing them to attack. If the target is a monster or a player, affect them with Physical Shield for 1 turn.
    Note that while Dispel Magic would also remove visibility effects (Blindness and Invisibility), the visibility changes will take place only on the next turn. For the cast turn of Dispel Magic visibility would still affect gesture and log visibility, spell targetting, and attack targetting.
    Can be successfully cast at any target, including nobody (however, the Physical Shield is only granted if the target is a player or a monster). Cannot cannot be made permanent.""",
    2: """Affects the target with Magic Shield and Physical Shield for 1 turn. Magic Shield counters most spells cast at the target (except for Finger of Death) and negates Fire Storm and Ice Storm effects on the target. Physical Shield protects the target from attacks.
    Fizzles if cast at nobody or at illegal targets (hands / not summoned monster). Casting at a monster that is summoned this turn fizzles Counter Spell since the monster is summoned only after all Counter Spells resolve.
    Can be cast at a player or a monster. Cannot be made permanent.""",
    3: """Affects the target with Magic Mirror for 1 turn. The Magic Mirror effect reflects all spells directed at the target back to the caster but does not affect other actions (monster attacks, stabs).
    Magic Mirror does not trigger for spells cast at self.
    Magic Mirror effect triggers if the spell is about to hit its target, so if a caster casts a spell at another target that is not visible to them (either the caster is affected with Blindness or the target is affected with invisibility) then Magic Mirror does not trigger (since the spell had missed). The same is true for the reflected spells - if the spell is reflected from the Magic Mirror, but the initial target does not see the initial caster, then the spell is considered to be cast at nobody (this is how the RB rules were worded but not how RB was implemented). If both caster and target are covered with Magic Mirrors, the spell also fizzles (this is not how it was implemented by RB).
    Magic Mirror can be countered, which normally is a non-issue since Magic Shield also counters everything that could potentially be mirrored. However, if a spell that cannot be countered (such as Finger of Death) is cast at the same target as Counter Spell, then the target's Magic Mirror would be countered and Finger of Death would hit.
    Note that if the effect of reflected spell required an order (f.e. reflected Paralysis or Charm Person), the orders will be given by the player affected by Magic Mirror effect, not by Magic Mirror caster. If Magic Mirror was cast at a monster, the orders will be given by monsters controller (in RB's implementation the effect didn't take place in this case).

    10: """If the target is a monster, this monster gains an additional attack for the duration of the spell effect (3 turns). These additional attacks happen after regular attacks and have the same target as the regular attack. The monster dealt lethal damage during the regular attack gets to have hasted attack before dying. This affects all monsters, including elementals (which is not how it worked at RB).
    If the target is a player, this player gets additional (hasted) turns after their regular turns for the duration of the effect (3 turns). If several players are affected by Haste, their hasted turns happen at the same time. Hasted turns are considered to be an extension of normal turns, so if the next turn is hasted, the effects (except Magic Mirror) do not expire or trickle down; thus it is possible, for example, to break a mindspell that was resolved during the normal turn by casting another mindspell at the same target during the hasted turn. Similarly, it is possible to cast a Counter Spell during the normal turn to protect the target from spells on both normal and hasted turns (and, f.e. cast Storm on the hasted turn). However, if an effect requires orders from a non-hasted player (f.e. Paralysis and Charm Person), it does not occur during the hasted turn, which, in turn, resets the hand choice for Paralysis.

    If the target is a player, this player gets an additional (timestopped) turn after this turn ends. If several players are affected by Timestop, their timestopped turns happen at the same time. During timestopped turns all lasting effects (including protection, resists, blindness) are ignored by timestopped players (note that Shield spells and Magic Mirror spells resolved during timestoped turns take their effect) but are preserved in the same way as hasted turn would behave. However, non-timestopped players do not see gestures of timestopped players (as if the timestopped players were both hasted and invisible).
    While lasting effects are ignored during Timestopped turns, a Timestopped player still can take special actions like delaying (banking) spells, firing banked spells, and making spells permanent.
